# Change
**Change** is an open source, Progressive Web App money management application designed for tracking spending transactions and planning financial goals. **Change** implements a dual-system architecture that separates spending management (tracking actual transactions) from planning management (setting financial goals and organizing spending categories).

# Description
**Change** structures and stores planning goals in easy to understand manner, focusing primarily on:
* Performance (fast response times) 
* Ease of use (good user experience) 
* Security (data stored on device or on own Google drive).
* Easy to understand, reusable code.

The application is developed entirely in vanilla Javascript in order for me to understand the challenges of developing a large system in a dynamic manner.

Spending transactions are then registered acording to your goal categories. You can always check your progress in a monthly report.
